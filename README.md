# About project :
A Text (News) summerization system using T5 Transformers (Hugging Face) and Pytorch Lightning. Here used News-Summary Dataset to train the model and predicting the summarize text.

1. Used Pytorch Lightning Framework for creating DataSet, DataLoader and DataModule.

2. Used T5 TokenizerFast for creating Embeddings Vector and model inputs.

3. Used T5 Transformers for training purposes and make prediction using the trained model to the given text input.
